This repository contains original work chiefly in c# by the BizHawk team (which is all provided under the MIT License), embedded submodules from other authors with their own licenses clearly provided, other embedded submodules from other authors WITHOUT their own licenses clearly provided, customizations by the BizHawk team to many of those submodules (which is provided under the MIT license), and compiled binary executable modules from other authors without their licenses OR their origins clearly indicated.

Due to the high degree of licensing heterogeneity of this repository and the nature of some of the licenses contained therein, its condition as-is should be considered an illegal combination of several incompatible GPL licenses.

However, if many of the C/C++ emulation cores were removed, the result would be an almost pristine MIT-licensed work. We are therefore providing this repository "under the MIT license" with the expectation that the c# parts of the remaining "frontend" elements authored the BizHawk team is what will be of interest to most people; and besides, those elements constitute the bulk of the original work.

In short, individuals with a keen interest in the licensing details of any portion of this repository should contact us or else assume it is a minefield.
