This is the experimental "waterbox" project for bizhawk.

libc.so, libgcc_s.so, libstdc++.so.6, and the waterbox executables are built with a modified verion of the midipix project.
The makefiles for the cores only support the cross compilation setup (build from whatever linux box you built midipix
from).

The mmglue portion of the midipix project is modified; get the correct version from <ssh://git@github.com/nattthebear/mmglue.git>.

gpgx: This is a modified version of our gpgx core
snes9x: Based off of snes9x 1.54.
